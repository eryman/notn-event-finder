Tomorrow, we will be inaugurating a thin-skinned, belligerent, imbicilic, staggerinly unqualified man-child, who was chosen by less than half of American voters, to the highest office in the land. 

I have never been more embarrassed to be an American.

And that is saying something.




Rather than "draining the swamp," he has selected a billionaire goon squad for his cabinet who have no record of public service (or even basic human decency, for that matter) who, quite literally, stand to make much more money by harming the American people than they do by helping. And they stand to LOSE a ton of money if they actually do their jobs and put the American people first. 

How do you think that's going to work out? Do you think that: a) They're all going to change their ways and do the right thing, or b) They're all going to screw us over from day one to further line their already needlessly huge wallets?

(If you chose "a," think harder and choose again.)
